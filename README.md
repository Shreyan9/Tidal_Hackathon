Audience: Elderly users, non-native language speakers.
Pain Point: Scammers exploit confusion during live calls.
Solution:

An AI wrapper that integrates with calling apps (e.g., Truecaller, default phone apps) to analyze conversations in real time .
Uses NLP + voice tone analysis to flag red flags (e.g., urgency, threats, "too good to be true" offers).
Proactive alerts : "Warning: This call matches 90% of IRS scam profiles. Hang up and report."
Twist: Add a "panic button" to auto-end the call and notify a trusted contact/family member.

Post-Call Scam Forensics
Audience: Anyone who misses a call or receives voicemails.
Pain Point: Scammers leave convincing voicemails (e.g., "fake bank alerts").
Solution:

An AI tool that transcribes and analyzes voicemails/call recordings for scam indicators.
Cross-checks suspicious claims with public databases (e.g., "This number is linked to 50 fraud reports").
Auto-generates a scam report to share with authorities or blocklists.
Twist: Integrate with WhatsApp/Telegram to verify if a "bank alert" is legitimate by cross-referencing official channels.
